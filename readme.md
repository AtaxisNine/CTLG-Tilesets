This repository stores individual sprites for Cataclysm: The Last Generation in PNG format, and also source files with layering in *PSD* (Photoshop), *XCF* (gimp 2.10) or *KRA* (Krita) formats. PNGs will then be compiled into a tileset using a python script maintained by mlangsdorf (The script is presently located in the main Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead repo under `tools/gfx_tools/compose.py`).
